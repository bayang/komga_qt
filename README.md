# Komga Qt


![CI](https://github.com/bayang/komga_qt/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

A read only Qt client for https://komga.org.

Still WIP at the moment.

Binaries are available to download in the Actions section and are provided as is.

## Keybindings in the read view : 

<kbd>space</kbd> : scroll down the page by bits, when at the bottom go to next page and so on  (so a book can basically be read by just pressing space until the end)

<kbd>pg-up</kbd> or <kbd>j</kbd> : previous page

<kbd>pg-down</kbd> or <kbd>k</kbd> : next page

<kbd>origin</kbd> or <kbd>l</kbd> : first page

<kbd>end</kbd> or <kbd>m</kbd> : last page

<kbd>+</kbd> and <kbd>-</kbd> : zoom in/out

<kbd>w</kbd> : fit page to width

<kbd>h</kbd> : fit page to height

<kbd>esc</kbd> : close the read view

A zoomed page can be moved with arrows or dragged with mouse
